Map of US Covid-19 Cases and Rates. Access them [here](https://tj717.github.io/US-Covid-19-Rates-and-Cases/map2.html) and [here](https://tj717.github.io/US-Covid-19-Rates-and-Cases/map1.html).



Data used: the 2020 COVID-19 case/death data are originally from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv). The population data used for calculating the case rates are from the [2018 ACS 5-year estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true). Both data are at the county level. The U.S. county boundary shapefile was downloaded from [the U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). The data was processed by Steven Bao.
